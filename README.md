# Machine-leaning-spark-NLP

In this research, firstly, I have accomplished NLP to analyze the performance of different Machine Learning model like
a)Na√Øve Bayes, 
b)Decision tree, 
c)Random forests 
by creating a Databricks cluster using spark

# case study
In addition, a case study performed for collecting Spark-streaming data from twitter on EMR cluster and storing, analyzing the collected tweets using Dynamo Db and Databricks cluster.

# Dependencies
